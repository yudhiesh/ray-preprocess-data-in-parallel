				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I would be dead, to be totally honest.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s how 12-year-old Conner McLaren responded to a ThinkProgress question about what her life would be like if she&rsquo;d had parents who forced her to be raised as a boy. Conner socially transitioned to living as a girl at age 4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I felt so wrong when I wasn&rsquo;t a girl. I felt like my connection with my family wasn&rsquo;t right. They were holding onto a piece of myself that wasn&rsquo;t myself. I was someone else. I probably would&rsquo;ve committed suicide,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I probably would&rsquo;ve made a few attempts.&rdquo;</span></p>

			</figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conner&rsquo;s story isn&rsquo;t unique, but it is relatively new. It&rsquo;s only in the last decade or two that U.S. society has seen its first generation of transgender kids who are out and proud both at home and at school&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;who live completely as a gender different from the sex they were assigned at birth. And though these kids appear to be thriving, there is a significant backlash against them, one that seeks to demonize their parents, segregate them in schools, and deny the legitimacy of their identities &mdash; all based on research that can most generously be described as imprecise.</span></p>
<div class="ad-wrapper" data-slot="1"><div class="ad-label">Advertisement</div><div class="ad-container ad-container--placeholder desktop box" id="div-gpt-ad-1499467661362-6"></div><div class="ad-container ad-container--placeholder mobile box" id="div-gpt-ad-1499467661362-14"></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it&rsquo;s so novel for kids to come out as transgender so young, there hasn&rsquo;t been an opportunity to conduct much research about what they&rsquo;ll experience when they do so. Those skeptical of affirming trans kids instead rely on a small collection of older studies to assert that some 80 percent of them will supposedly &ldquo;desist&rdquo; (i.e. not persist) in being transgender&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;that they won&rsquo;t actually turn out to be transgender as adults. Many kids, they warn, are being harmed by &ldquo;social experimentation&rdquo; and &ldquo;gender propaganda,&rdquo; and the 80 percent desistance rate proves that their gender identities are illegitimate and that they&rsquo;ll grow out of them. The underlying assumption is that they&rsquo;ll be better off if they do grow up to be cisgender.</span></p>

<h3 class="related-content__title">How A Conservative Law Firm Convinced A School System To Gamble On An Anti-Transgender Policy</h3>

<p>	</p></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite skepticism from those who believe most trans kids will &mdash; and should &mdash; desist, therapists and families like Conner&rsquo;s are moving forward with social transitions. In doing so, they are allowing for a new wave of research to be conducted that is already starkly contradicting the desistance research regarding who exactly transgender kids are and what they are actually experiencing.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who exactly are transgender kids?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of LGBTQ visibility over the past 100 years has forced society to reconcile the complexities of gender and sexuality, and this has been especially true for children, who are often unfairly considered too young to understand these aspects of their identity.</span></p>
<div class="ad-wrapper" data-slot="2"><div class="ad-label">Advertisement</div><div class="ad-container ad-container--placeholder desktop box" id="div-gpt-ad-1499467661362-7"></div><div class="ad-container ad-container--placeholder mobile box" id="div-gpt-ad-1499467661362-15"></div></div><p><a href="http://www.dianeehrensaft.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diane Ehrensaft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who serves as director of mental health for the Child and Adolescent Gender Center at the University of California San Francisco, explained to ThinkProgress how slow society has been to sort out all these different aspects of gender. &ldquo;There has been a conflation for many years between being gender nonconforming in one&rsquo;s expressions and being either transgender or other in one&rsquo;s gender identity,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;People get all that mixed up with sexual orientation. All three get collapsed into one.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though she celebrates the fact that &ldquo;gender limits are being blown out of the water,&rdquo; she still sees a divide between how people understand children&rsquo;s gender. The more conservative approach assumes a &ldquo;specific pathway of gender development&rdquo; that kids can be steered toward, with the idealized outcome that they will identify with the gender they were assigned at birth, perform that gender, and be heterosexual. The more progressive approach, on the other hand, appreciates that &ldquo;gender comes in infinite varieties&rdquo; and that all of those variations are healthy, &nbsp;allowing for children to have the space to explore and grow into whoever they turn out to be, even if that changes over time.</span></p>
<div class="responsive-video"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpE3d69SiDU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ehrensaft&rsquo;s eagerness to celebrate the diversity of gender in kids was informed by the journey of her own son, Jeff. As a kid, Jeff was, as she described him, &ldquo;gender creative,&rdquo; and would wear dresses around the house, but he ultimately grew up to be a gay man. Identifying with feminine traits or preferences is quite different from actually identifying as a girl, but even the world of psychiatry hasn&rsquo;t always appreciated that delineation. Indeed, it was less than five years ago that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) formally recognized such a distinction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The APA&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DSM) contains a set of criteria specifically for &ldquo;gender identity disorder in children&rdquo; (GID), but those criteria was significantly changed when the APA published its newest edition (the DSM-5) in 2013.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In</span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/images/asset_upload_file155_30369.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the DSM-IV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was in use from 1994 to 2013, the diagnosis required children to meet four out of five listed criteria. The first of those was a &ldquo;repeatedly stated desire to be, or insistence that he or she is, the other sex,&rdquo; but the other four criteria reflected the kind of preferences Ehrensaft&rsquo;s son expressed as a kid, like &ldquo;cross-dressing,&rdquo; a &ldquo;preference for cross-sex roles in make-believe play,&rdquo; preferring games and toys &ldquo;of the other sex,&rdquo; and preferring playmates &ldquo;of the other sex.&rdquo; Separate from the four-out-of-five criteria, they must have additionally expressed discomfort in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">either</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their body or their gender roles; for young children that could be something like a boy rejecting rough-and-tumble play or stereotypically masculine toys and games.</span></p>
<div class="ad-wrapper" data-slot="3"><div class="ad-label">Advertisement</div><div class="ad-container ad-container--placeholder desktop box" id="div-gpt-ad-1499467661362-8"></div><div class="ad-container ad-container--placeholder mobile box" id="div-gpt-ad-1499467661362-16"></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the DSM-IV, a pre-adolescent Jeff could have potentially been diagnosed as having GID. &ldquo;I asked him in adulthood, whether he could imagine being a six-year-old and taking a different pathway and identifying as a transgender child,&rdquo; Ehrensaft recalled. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Absolutely not. I knew my gender.&rsquo;&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a lesson she applies when she works with kids and families as a private therapist. &ldquo;If you want to know a child&rsquo;s gender, ask them; don&rsquo;t tell them.&rdquo;</span></p>

			</figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the DSM-5 came out, it</span><a href="http://www.ifge.org/302.6_Gender_Identity_Disorder_in_Children"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">changed that diagnostic approach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a rather significant way. Under the new guidelines, to be diagnosed with what is now referred to as &ldquo;</span><a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gender dysphoria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&rdquo; children </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meet that first criterion of desiring or insisting that they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&ldquo;the other sex.&rdquo; If that doesn&rsquo;t describe their experience, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many of the other gender nonconforming criteria they meet; they can&rsquo;t be diagnosed. In other words, there&rsquo;s no way a kid like Jeff could now be classified as having gender dysphoria just because of his feminine characteristics.</span></p>

If a kid is adamant that they are a gender different from what they were assigned at birth, that feeling doesn&rsquo;t go away, and it plays out across their entire life, it distinguishes what that child is experiencing from other kids who are gender nonconforming but not transgender. It also more closely mirrors</span><a href="http://www.ifge.org/302.85_Gender_Identity_Disorder_in_Adolescents_or_Adults"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how transgender adults are diagnosed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Research has found that children </span><a href="http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/trans?page=guidelines-youth"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as young as 18 months</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can articulate these aspects of their gender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ehrensaft explained that one way to recognize insistence, persistence, and consistence is to distinguish between whether the kid is engaging in fantasy play or &ldquo;serious work.&rdquo; For example, &ldquo;if a little boy is [persistently] saying they&rsquo;re a girl, they don&rsquo;t want the Elsa costume, they want the school [uniform] dress.&rdquo; In her work, she has found that it&rsquo;s not actually that difficult to glean from a child whether he simply has feminine traits or preferences or if she is insisting she <em>is</em> a girl</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &ldquo;If you sit down with them, you can actually sort out apples and oranges&rdquo; and distinguish transgender kids like Conner from gender nonconforming kids like Jeff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But essentially, until at least 2013, therapy protocols weren&rsquo;t formally sorting out apples and oranges. And neither were researchers. While there were some kids expressing what would now be understood as a &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; identity and some who weren&rsquo;t, they were all lumped together under the umbrella of being gender nonconforming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that&rsquo;s one of the main reasons the &ldquo;desistance&rdquo; research just doesn&rsquo;t hold up.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shoddy roots of the desistance myth</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dating back decades, there are</span><a href="http://www.sexologytoday.org/2016/01/do-trans-kids-stay-trans-when-they-grow_99.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">about a dozen studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that prop up the desistance myth. Each claims to have studied a cohort of kids with GID and found that a significant percentage (around 60 to 90 percent) of those kids ended up &ldquo;desisting&rdquo; in their gender dysphoria and embracing the gender that they were assigned at birth. Even the </span><a href="http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(13)00187-1/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most recent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of these studies, however, relied upon the older DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, and that&rsquo;s just the beginning of their flaws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their 2016 book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raising the Transgender Child</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dr. Michele Angello and Alisa Bowman break down the main problems with the research into three main concerns. First, the studies included children who simply were not transgender. Several also concluded that participants desisted simply because they did not complete the study. Moreover &mdash; especially given these first two flaws &mdash; the sample sizes of actual transgender kids were incredibly small (with most including fewer than five).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristina Olson, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Washington, is pioneering a new wave of research about transgender kids that aims to avoid these pitfalls, and as such, she&rsquo;s also been one of the</span><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/01/14/what_alarmist_articles_about_transgender_children_get_wrong.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">most outspoken critics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the conclusions drawn from desistance studies. In a</span><a href="http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2815%2900794-7/abstract"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 critique</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she explained succinctly, &ldquo;[C]lose inspection of these studies suggests that most children in these studies were not transgender to begin with.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in two of the studies, &ldquo;[w]hen directly asked what their gender is, more than 90% &nbsp;of children with GID in these clinics reported an answer that aligned with their natal sex, the clearest evidence that most did not see themselves as transgender.&rdquo; Essentially, a tomboyish girl would say she still identified as a girl, but would be counted as transgender in the study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with ThinkProgress, Olson further expounded on how weak the standard was for assessing which children to include in many of these studies. &ldquo;A very significant number of kids, 30 to 40 percent, didn&rsquo;t even meet the criteria for GID,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Even if you thought they met that criteria, which is already less strong than the current criteria, you&rsquo;re still looking at kids that didn&rsquo;t meet the criteria.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colt Keo-Meier, a clinical child psychologist based in Houston who specializes in gender identity issues, summed up the desistance research to ThinkProgress thusly: &ldquo;When they were older, of course they didn&rsquo;t transition because they weren&rsquo;t transgender to start with.&rdquo;</span></p>

			</figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Keo-Meier also takes great exception to the fact that some of the studies just assumed, without actual evidence, that the children who dropped out had all &ldquo;desisted.&rdquo; For example, in a</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21216800"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2011 study in the Netherlands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Thomas Steensma, nearly half (24 out of 53) of the participants didn&rsquo;t return to the clinic conducting the study during adolescence. Because it was the only gender identity clinic for children and adolescents in the country, the researchers assumed that if they didn&rsquo;t come back, those children must no longer be experiencing gender dysphoria. A</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23702447"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2013 follow-up study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Steensma,&nbsp;</span>the most recent in the desistance pantheon, made the same assumption when 80 of its 127 participants did not return to the Amsterdam clinic.</p>
<p>According to researchers, of those 80 participants, only 46 participants and the parents of six others returned questionnaires that appeared to confirm this assumption. Of those remaining, 24 either didn&rsquo;t respond to the questionnaire or were untraceable. Only four responded that they were no longer experiencing gender dysphoria, but declined to participate in the study or any follow-up questionnaires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see that in any study,&rdquo; Keo-Meier said of drawing conclusions about participants who didn&rsquo;t actually complete the study. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any idea how that got published! You just drop those people from your total percentages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of those who never responded to follow-up questions, Angello and Bowman noted, &ldquo;They might have switched doctors, moved, or worse, committed suicide. Also, it&rsquo;s common for transgender people to express their true gender, face an abundance of ridicule and harassment, and then repress it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.17188rem;">In other words, it&rsquo;s the equivalent of a dentist who wrongly assumes that, if 24 of his patients stop coming back, it must mean that they&rsquo;re no longer getting cavities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drop-off in participation in these studies &mdash; and the unwarranted assumption about what that means&#8202; &mdash; undermines how much can be generalized from them. Their sample sizes were small to begin with, there was significant drop-off, and the number of actual trans participants was a fraction of what remained. Madeline Deutsch, clinical director at the University of California San Francisco&rsquo;s Center of Excellence for Transgender Health, explained to ThinkProgress that she suspects this isn&rsquo;t a coincidence given who was conducting these studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deutsch believes that, in addition to their other flaws, the desistance studies suffer from a selection bias because many were conducted looking only at patients who came to academic referral centers instead of assessing a wider population of patients seeing different caregivers in different locations. Families might wind up at these clinics because they didn&rsquo;t have an affirming local therapist, or conversely because the parents were hoping to correct their child&rsquo;s gender. &ldquo;When a child is taken by parents who are not super supportive to an academic medical center in a city 100 miles away; they&rsquo;re sat down at a table with a bunch of people who aren&rsquo;t trans and are wearing white coats; and they ask them a zillion questions and take a zillion tests, I&rsquo;m not surprised that some of those kids are like, &lsquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m not really trans,&rsquo;&rdquo; she explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Deutsch finds it conspicuous how few transgender researchers were actually involved in the desistance studies. Skepticism about letting kids transition, she said, &ldquo;is driven underlyingly by a field of predominantly non-transgender researchers who are trying to turn this into some kind of field that is of interest and that is curious so they can generate more research and publications. It is not something that is being driven by the community.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s not that she thinks only trans people should do this kind of research, but she questions the motives of people who aren&rsquo;t working with the trans community to study the trans community. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really mind-boggling,&rdquo; she said, pointing out that researchers studying another demographic like racial minorities, immigrants, or substance abusers would likewise be expected to seek investment from the groups they were studying.</span></p>
<h2>A new approach to studying trans kids</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olson has designed a massive new study, the</span><a href="https://depts.washington.edu/transyp/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TransYouth Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to compensate for the flaws of the desistance research. To make sure she&rsquo;s capturing the experience of kids who are actually trans, she&rsquo;s only including participants who have fully socially transitioned their gender in every aspect of their lives &mdash; at home, at school, and everywhere else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olson&rsquo;s research is only possible because of the recent rapid growth in transgender acceptance in society. &ldquo;This project couldn&rsquo;t happen if it wasn&rsquo;t the case that we had affirming families today,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;And certainly, I couldn&rsquo;t have done this work even five years ago. To get enough families would have been impossible.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s still recruiting families through this year, but all told, the study will have over 300 participants, and as long as the funding holds out, she&rsquo;ll follow them for 20 years&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;well into their adulthood.</span></p>

			</figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the TransYouth project&rsquo;s cohort is still growing, it has already produced some preliminary findings that directly challenge the desistance myth. For example, a</span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/transgender-kids-identify-with-their-gender-as-completely-as-cisgender-kids-915737190980"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2015 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 32 participants found that transgender kids identify as consistently and innately with their gender as their cisgender peers and siblings do. In 2016, Olson found that</span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/transgender-kids-thrive-when-their-parents-embrace-their-identities-b8d68d298ac2"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">having supportive parents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> virtually eliminates most of the mental health concerns transgender children are known to experience. Kids who had socially transitioned demonstrated &ldquo;developmentally normative levels of depression and anxiety.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/trans-kids-socially-transition-study-529f34c1bb3b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Olson investigated whether her previous results were biased because they relied on parents to report on the health of their child. This latest study of 63 transgender kids confirmed their normative mental health rates, but also found that parents actually reported </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> levels of anxiety in the kids than the kids reported in themselves. Essentially, parents weren&rsquo;t playing up how well their kids were doing, but were, in fact, being overly cautious in their observations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TransYouth Project is only the first part of Olson&rsquo;s grand vision for new research on the gender of kids. As recruitment comes to a close for kids who have socially transitioned, she and her colleagues are also recruiting a whole separate cohort of kids who are gender nonconforming but who have not socially transitioned &mdash; i.e., a group that more closely resembles the participants in the desistance studies. By intentionally distinguishing this group from the trans kids and then following them into adulthood, Olson will be better equipped to draw the kinds of predictive conclusions the desistance studies tried to draw about who will grow up to be trans and who won&rsquo;t. &ldquo;[W]e expect at least some of them </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> socially transition, so that will give us some data from before and after,&rdquo; she explained. But for those who do not identify as trans, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll also be able to see if there are patterns of response in early childhood that predict who ends up socially transitioning or who identifies as trans later in life based on their presentation when they were very young.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TransYouth Project is not the only new research underway. Robert Garofalo, a pediatrician who directs the Center for Gender, Sexuality &amp; HIV Prevention at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Chicago, is spearheading </span><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/largest-ever-study-of-transgender-teenagers-set-to-kick-off-1.19637"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another massive study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will specifically investigate the medical impacts of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones on transgender young people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional smaller studies are also providing new insights into trans kids&rsquo; experiences. For example, a 2015 study at Rady Children&rsquo;s Hospital in San Diego found that almost all of the 42 trans adolescents in the study </span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375"><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefited from the physical transition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> steps they took, including puberty blockers, cross-sex hormone therapy, and mastectomies. Almost all of the participants who had previously experienced depression, anxiety, and self-harm reported improvement, and none of them regretted the steps they took.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the new research is being collected, families and therapists are continuing to support transgender children as they grow up in a society that hasn&rsquo;t seen a group like them before. And they are doing so precisely because transitioning is having such a noticeable positive impact on these kids&rsquo; lives.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trans kids and their families correct the record</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents of transgender equality peddle a number of myths about transgender kids that all depend to some degree on the desistance myth. They argue, for example, that </span><a href="http://thefederalist.com/2017/02/28/blame-parents-share-sudden-emergence-trans-kids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parents are &ldquo;complicit&rdquo;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;in turning their kids trans by allowing them to explore gender nonconforming play. Being trans is </span><a href="http://thefederalist.com/2017/02/08/parents-guide-not-transing-kids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a social trend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a </span><a href="http://thefederalist.com/2016/11/17/psychiatry-professor-transgenderism-mass-hysteria-similar-1980s-era-junk-science/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mass hysteria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and kids are </span><a href="https://stream.org/transgender-is-trendy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spontaneously self-diagnosing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as transgender out of rebellion after reading about it on the internet. Children who are really struggling with their gender identity are just </span><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439126/transgender-teens-parents-cry-foul-doctors-and-educators-ignore-them"><span style="font-weight: 400;">going through a phase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just </span><a href="http://thefederalist.com/2015/12/14/cutting-off-a-childs-body-parts-is-no-prank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">need a stern talking to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or just </span><a href="http://thefederalist.com/2017/05/11/conversion-therapy-bans-trojan-horse-ensnaring-transgender-children/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">need corrective therapy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to convince them to embrace the gender they were assigned at birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These claims are designed to discourage parents from affirming their kids and they are all premised on the bias that being transgender is a bad outcome. What gender therapists actually see are families who are simply concerned about the well-being of their children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest concern Keo-Meier hears from parents is, &ldquo;I want to make sure that nothing is going to hurt my child.&rdquo; Parents might recognize that their kids&rsquo; lives will be harder because of discrimination, bullying, harassment, and violence. They might likewise worry about their kids&rsquo; wellness, knowing the high rates of depression, substance abuse, and suicidality that the trans community can experience as a result of that stigma and mistreatment. And they might worry whether somebody will ever be able to love their child. Generally, by the time a kid arrives in his office, the parents have already noticed gender-related concerns for some time, have weighed these questions, and now want to do what&rsquo;s best for their child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a common misconception that this all happens so fast,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;[T]hese are not decisions made in haste. This is not, &lsquo;One day my kid randomly said [&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a different gender&rsquo;] and so therefore we&rsquo;re transitioning them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

Helping kids socially transition is about trial and error and assessing the impact that each change is having on their mental health.</span></p>

					<figcaption>CREDIT: Pete Tchoryk</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pete and Sarah Tchoryk of Michigan became very concerned about their two-year-old Jacq Kai a few years back. He was exhibiting a number of signs of psychological distress, including obsessive-compulsive behaviors and massive tantrums that disrupted the entire family&rsquo;s schedules. Despite having been designated female at birth, he was also insisting that he was a boy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Right from the beginning, he started saying his body parts didn&rsquo;t match and kept asking about that,&rdquo; Pete recalled, inquiring specifically, &ldquo;Well, when am I going to get a peanut?&rdquo; &mdash; his pronunciation of &nbsp;&ldquo;penis&rdquo; at the time. Jacq started to refuse to wear dresses or any clothes he perceived to be &ldquo;girly,&rdquo; throwing such radical tantrums that Pete and Sarah couldn&rsquo;t get him out the door to daycare &mdash; becoming late for work themselves. He would show great distress when people referred to him as a girl, which was frequent because of how people perceived his long hair. Unsure of how to help him, they started taking him to see a therapist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, as Pete was dropping Jacq off at daycare, Jacq looked in the car&rsquo;s rearview mirror, started crying, and said, &ldquo;I look like a girl! My hair&rsquo;s too long; I&rsquo;m not going inside.&rdquo; When Pete took him to get a short haircut, at the therapist&rsquo;s suggestion, it was &ldquo;one of the happiest days of his life.&rdquo; But still there were times when Jacq said he didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable even in the &ldquo;boy clothes&rdquo; his parents had gotten him, and that&rsquo;s when they figured out that it wasn&rsquo;t just about the clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even just a few years ago, the desistance myth was one of the only answers available for parents concerned about their kids&rsquo; gender, so the Tchoryks were very familiar with it. Because the theory seeks to avoid letting kids transition, it instead suggests that psychological issues like Jacq&rsquo;s be treated without affirming the gender identity he&rsquo;s espousing. But Sarah and Pete found that the more they let Jacq be the boy he said he was, the less there were any psychological issues to address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing that the small gradual changes they were making weren&rsquo;t enough, they asked Jacq&rsquo;s school to start referring to him by his &ldquo;boy name&rdquo; and with masculine pronouns, and according to Pete, &ldquo;It was as simple as that. It truly was a lightswitch. He came home happy that day and the next morning just couldn&rsquo;t wait to get out to go to school.&rdquo; Jacq&rsquo;s tantrums and obsessive-compulsive behaviors disappeared, and they no longer had problems getting him out the door in the morning.</span></p>

			</figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacq is now eight and entering the fourth grade. He loves going to school and this year he&rsquo;s hoping to explain his identity to his classmates all by himself. &ldquo;I want my classmates to know I&rsquo;m trans, but they shouldn&rsquo;t be scared of me or think I&rsquo;m weird,&rdquo; he told ThinkProgress. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just who I am.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pete and Sarah are questioned all the time about whether they did the right thing by fully supporting Jacq&rsquo;s transition, but Pete simply responds, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to help our kids survive </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">now</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That&rsquo;s how all medical treatment really is done. We want kids to survive now and as situations may change, you can address it.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re just glad Jacq&rsquo;s a happy kid. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the downside of the child changing if it&rsquo;s going to help them be happier and safer in life?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though Jacq doesn&rsquo;t really remember the days of his tantrums and anguish, he does have a good sense of what his life would be like if he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to be the boy that he is. &ldquo;I think I would just be really miserable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I probably would spend a lot of time in a dark room.&rdquo;</span></p>

					<figcaption>CREDIT: Melissa McLaren</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of the desistance myth often try to dismiss the legitimacy of kids&rsquo; trans identities by claiming they&rsquo;re simply responding to </span><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/12/28/transgender-fad-rapidly-spreading-primary-schools-clusters-emerging-children-copy-friends/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trends or fads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or some sort of &ldquo;</span><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439126/transgender-teens-parents-cry-foul-doctors-and-educators-ignore-them"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social contagion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; they learn from others. But that reasoning doesn&rsquo;t explain why Melissa and Mikael McLarens&rsquo; daughter Conner, at age 3, was distressed about her genitals, expressed a preference for girls&rsquo; clothes, and said almost daily that she wanted to grow up to be a mommy, not a daddy. And Conner&rsquo;s distress was particularly noticeable because it was so distinct from her identical twin brother, Murphy. According to Melissa, &ldquo;They were different in ways that weren&rsquo;t typical.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As parents, they really struggled with how to support Conner. Desistance-based suggestions like &ldquo;downplay anything feminine&rdquo; and promoting &ldquo;the father figure&rdquo; and gender norms in the household were &ldquo;absolutely not okay with how we view our lives,&rdquo; Mikael said. The opposite approach &mdash; letting Conner just set her own limits &mdash; didn&rsquo;t jibe with how they wanted to parent such a young child. But as Conner&rsquo;s anxiety increased, they knew they couldn&rsquo;t do nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were living in Minneapolis at the time and traveled to Chicago to see a therapist, who encouraged them to be affirming of Conner&rsquo;s gender. Desistance believers tell tall tales about kids who are </span><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/its-absurd-to-claim-that-trans-kids-are-being-rushed-into-transitioning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;rushed&rdquo; into transitioning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or who are </span><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2017/08/kindergarten-boy-instantly-turns-into-girl-in-school/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transitioning &ldquo;instantly,&rdquo;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;but the McLarens&rsquo; therapist suggested they take the smallest steps possible when allowing Conner to transition and assess the impact each change has on her well-being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We went ahead and put both gender clothes in the chest of drawers and let Conner choose what she was going to wear for the day,&rdquo; Melissa offered as an example, &ldquo;and I can tell you at that point we never again wore any boys clothes&rsquo; ever.&rdquo; They tried out gender-neutral pronouns, but that only worked for a day or two. Indeed, shortly after they began using female pronouns at home, Conner took it upon herself to tell her classmates to stop using boy pronouns at school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking from their home in Ohio, the McLarens told ThinkProgress that letting Conner be herself completely changed who she was in remarkable ways. &ldquo;I joke that at that point the princess had been let out of the castle and she was never going back in. She just blossomed,&rdquo; Melissa said, explaining that up until that point she thought Conner was more of a wallflower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mikael said the difference was stark. &ldquo;She had never really had a voice, even when it came to business. She was always just ok with whatever you wanted,&rdquo; he said. But after she fully transitioned, it was the first time they saw her &ldquo;happy with her own skin.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;That moment was the most magical time,&rdquo; Conner, now 12, recalled. &ldquo;I felt like nothing could go wrong. I felt like nothing was impossible. I could go to the moon if I wanted to. I had dreams of being such a strong woman when I grew up. As soon as I put on that dress and realized I&rsquo;m a girl, this is who I am, and my family accepted me, I wanted to make the world a better place for other children like me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The McLarens simply can&rsquo;t reconcile everything they&rsquo;ve heard about desistance with Conner&rsquo;s experiences. &ldquo;When we saw that our child was happy and healthy and thriving,&rdquo; Melissa said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s how you determine that an intervention is working.&rdquo; Mikael added, &ldquo;You would rather have a happy, healthy, well-functioning daughter than an anxious son. It was a difficult decision, but it was an easy decision.&rdquo;</span></p>

			</figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conner understands the desistance concerns too. &ldquo;People might think, &lsquo;Well, they&rsquo;re just going to grow out of it because 80 percent grow out of it.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s not true, because you know who you&rsquo;re going to be when you transition,&rdquo; she said. Because of the legacy of caution from the desistance myth, Conner&rsquo;s still only taking hormone blockers, and she&rsquo;s impatient to start undergoing the kinds of permanent changes other girls her age are already experiencing. &ldquo;I know that right now I should be on girl hormones &mdash; I should! &mdash; because my heart and my brain tell me the same thing: I am a girl. I know I&rsquo;m a girl and I&rsquo;ve truly always been a girl.&rdquo;</span></p>

					<figcaption>CREDIT: Vanessa Ford</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families that have already been in the public eye about their trans kids know all too well how persistent proponents of the desistance myth can be. Vanessa Ford&rsquo;s family, which lives in the Boston area, has been </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2017/02/06/im-not-a-boy-im-a-girl-she-told-her-parents-heres-how-they-handled-it/?utm_term=.00ceb3ac25cb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profiled in the Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several times and they were featured in the </span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/gender-revolution-is-the-transgender-explainer-we-re-overdue-for-6e231ddc5a2b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent Katie Couric documentary</span></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gender Revolution</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When her daughter Ellie, now six, first started transitioning at age four, Vanessa remembered the biggest question being, &ldquo;What if she changes her mind?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;At the time, I knew that we didn&rsquo;t have any other option but to listen to her,&rdquo; she told ThinkProgress. &ldquo;I remember initially saying, &lsquo;Well, if she does [change her mind], then we&rsquo;ll listen to her then.&rsquo; Right? We&rsquo;re listening to her now; we&rsquo;ll listen to her then.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was her curiosity about the possibility of desistance that motivated the family to participate in Olson&rsquo;s TransYouth Project. &ldquo;The research coming out of this study has never been done before, and it&rsquo;s something to grasp onto, because the only research that was out there has been debunked.&rdquo; Proponents of the desistance myth have nevertheless </span><a href="http://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/06/22/lisa-marchiano-trouble-transing-kids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tried to fill that gap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with warnings that kids like Ellie will change their minds, speculating without any evidence that it could be traumatic to transition back to the sex they were assigned at birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in the barrage of questions about how Ellie knows, whether she&rsquo;s too young, and whether her family should wait, Vanessa says simply, &ldquo;For us, waiting hurts our child.&rdquo;</span></p>

					<figcaption>CREDIT: Debi Jackson</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because proponents of desistance doubt the legitimacy of kids&rsquo; transgender identities, they often find ways to blame parents for somehow forcing their kids to be trans or &mdash; borrowing directly from </span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/ex-gay-advocates-claim-homosexuality-is-caused-by-parental-abuse-2ccd45de93d6/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ex-gay therapy rhetoric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &mdash; disturbing their development with physical or sexual abuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debi and Tom Jackson of Kansas City, Missouri, had been used to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayyjUznc610">speaking out</a> about their transgender ten-year-old Avery, but they were not prepared for the tsunami of negative feedback they received after she </span><a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/01/editors-note-gender/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">graced the cover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of National Geographic&rsquo;s recent issue on gender. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detractors assumed from the photo that Debi and Tom forced Avery to adopt a transgender identity because of what they perceived to be feminine preferences. Debi explained, &ldquo;Because of National Geographic, one of the big things is: &lsquo;Oh look, the kid who thinks that she has to be a girl because she likes the color pink. She wants pink hair, she has a pink shirt on, and she&rsquo;s wearing pink pants, so if they would&rsquo;ve just taught her that boys can like pink, she wouldn&rsquo;t have had to take this on.&rsquo;&rdquo; In reality, most of Avery&rsquo;s wardrobe isn&rsquo;t even pink, and they didn&rsquo;t even know she was going to be photographed that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, Avery is &ldquo;a tomboy,&rdquo; Debi explained, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s not a boy, and she&rsquo;s clear about that with her friends.&rdquo;</span></p>

					<figcaption>CREDIT: National Geographic/Debi Jackson</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom recounted some of the &ldquo;vile and disgusting&rdquo; claims he&rsquo;s heard </span><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article122430344.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">since the magazine was published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: &ldquo;I must be a pedophile and I must be raping Avery because that&rsquo;s the only way a boy would think that he&rsquo;s a girl, or that my wife must have Munchausen&rsquo;s [</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchausen_syndrome_by_proxy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">syndrome by proxy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">] because that&rsquo;s the only way Avery would be transgender, or that Avery&rsquo;s the anti-Christ because she&rsquo;s going to bring about the end of days, that she&rsquo;s the leader of the satanic Illuminati and that she&rsquo;s in control of all the liberal conglomerates of the world.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThinkProgress confirmed there were multiple videos on YouTube making these outrageous claims specifically about the Jacksons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If people knew the stuff we had to deal with in our six years of parenting Avery,&rdquo; Tom said, &ldquo;why would someone choose to do that as a trendy or &lsquo;fun&rsquo; experiment? You do it because it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in the best interest of your kid.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debi added that it makes just as little sense to be skeptical of transgender kids themselves, given they often experience bullying and bathroom segregation at school. &ldquo;Why would they keep that up if it wasn&rsquo;t such an integral part of who they are? People aren&rsquo;t going to put themselves into a marginalized category to be bullied and harassed just for kicks.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What could have been/what always was</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the kids currently being studied will become the first generation of trans adults who grew up transitioned since childhood, the stories of people who transition later in life further undermine the desistance myth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the challenges many families face is finding doctors who are prepared to work with transgender kids. There are therapists and endocrinologists with experience working with cisgender kids or with transgender adults, but fewer with experience working with transgender kids. That was the case for the gender therapist the Jacksons took Avery to, who had never worked with a patient so young.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Debi recalls, the therapist was a bit taken aback when Avery, at age 4, described how she knew that she was a girl on the inside, in her heart and in her brain. It was the exact same sentiment her older patients had articulated, and it was as genuine an expression of her identity as it was for the adults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The therapist&rsquo;s adult patients, some of whom hadn&rsquo;t even begun to transition, would occasionally get together for a &ldquo;girls night out&rdquo; where they could be themselves and support each other, and they invited Debi to join them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never met a trans adult that I was aware of,&rdquo; she recalled, and she explained to them that she thought her child was trans and asked to hear about their experiences. &ldquo;Every single one of them had said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know why they don&rsquo;t trust kids. I&rsquo;ve been saying since I was 3,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been saying since I was 6,&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve known since I was a child, and if only people would have listened to us then, we wouldn&rsquo;t have gone through the hell that we&rsquo;ve gone through our whole lives.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transgender activist and writer</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Julia Serano</span><a href="https://medium.com/@juliaserano/detransition-desistance-and-disinformation-a-guide-for-understanding-transgender-children-993b7342946e"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recently explained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how experiences with transphobia can significantly delay when a person identifies themselves as transgender:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I experienced intense gender dysphoria as a child. But living in a transphobic world with no gender-affirming options whatsoever, I learned to deeply repress those feelings in order to survive. If some researcher were to have carried out a follow up exam on me when I was eighteen, or twenty-one, or twenty-four, I probably would have described myself as a &ldquo;happy cisgender male&rdquo; (except for the fact that nobody was using the word &ldquo;cisgender&rdquo; back then). But repression only holds for so long, and I eventually had to come to terms with my gender dysphoria. I transitioned in my early thirties. Other transsexuals do so in their forties, or fifties, or even later.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stories of people who transitioned as adults reflect how times have changed and how much more accepting society has become of children who do not conform to the expectations of their assigned gender.</span></p>

			</figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her family actually subjected her to violence and forced her to conform to being a boy. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to show emotion, I had to play male-dominated sports, I was forced to get into fights and I had to accept violence for being a sissy,&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;Like random attacks. My family would just attack me.&rdquo; Maynard wasn&rsquo;t even allowed to have female friends. &ldquo;I compartmentalized myself very rigidly,&rdquo; she said, finding ways to express her identity only when she was away from her family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Maynard was 21, her mother committed suicide, calling her before her death to apologize and to encourage her &ldquo;to try to be happy,&rdquo; but she just couldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;She encouraged me, but I was too repressed.&rdquo; She buried her identity for another 18 years. By all appearances, she fit the desistance myth&rsquo;s expectations perfectly &mdash; until she didn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three years ago, Maynard realized she just couldn&rsquo;t repress being trans anymore and had to cope with the dysphoria she&rsquo;d been experiencing. Transitioning has already made a big difference in her life, and she describes herself as being &ldquo;in a very blessed situation as far as trans people go.&rdquo; But she knows her entire life would be different if she could have experienced acceptance at a young age. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t comprehend what I lost really. I&rsquo;m glad sometimes that I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p>

					<figcaption>CREDIT: Gunner Scott</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gunner Scott, 47, came to understand his identity more gradually, first coming out as a &ldquo;queer bisexual lesbian&rdquo; when he was around 21, then changing the name and gender on his identity documents around age 31. He now identifies as transgender and genderqueer, but, he told ThinkProgress, he suspects he could have started that journey earlier if his family hadn&rsquo;t tried to suppress his gender at a young age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a teen, he felt very uncomfortable &ldquo;presenting as feminine,&rdquo; but at a therapist&rsquo;s recommendation, his family forced him &ldquo;to be more feminine&rdquo; anyway. &ldquo;Clothing was a big point of contention at my house,&rdquo; he said. He wasn&rsquo;t even allowed to wear jeans to school because they were considered &ldquo;too much like a boy.&rdquo; In fact, his parents overcompensated, buying him clothes &ldquo;that were for 30-year-old women. Not wanting to be so feminine, that made it really difficult.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The therapist encouraged my parents to continue to reward me for dressing appropriately,&rdquo; he explained, giving him privileges like taking out the car. They wouldn&rsquo;t ground him for wearing &ldquo;more masculine clothing,&rdquo; but they tried to monitor his dress and buy his clothes for him so they would be more feminine. He&rsquo;d pack jeans, sneakers, and t-shirts to change into at school, but would change back before he got home so they wouldn&rsquo;t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott, who now lives in Seattle and is well known for his trans advocacy, isn&rsquo;t sure what his life would have been like if he&rsquo;d been freer to express himself at a younger age, noting that there were many other factors that impacted his development, such as his biological father&rsquo;s abuse of his mother and his own experiences with homelessness and poverty. &ldquo;Being trans and coming out was a way for me to take control of my life and the situations around me. If I had done that [earlier],&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s so hard to say.&rdquo;</span></p>

					<figcaption>CREDIT: Amanda Hunter</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Hunter, a cabinet maker in Ontario, Canada, had a childhood that was a lot like how Jacq Tchoryk thinks his would be if he hadn&rsquo;t been affirmed in his transition. &ldquo;I stayed home, I stayed alone,&rdquo; she told ThinkProgress. She knew she was trans around age 10, but at age 15, her mom&rsquo;s doctor sent her to the Clarke Institute to receive reparative therapy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto&rsquo;s Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, later incorporated into the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), ran a Child Gender Identity Clinic </span><a href="http://www.tsroadmap.com/info/clarke-institute.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that was so notorious</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for its regressive ex-trans practices that many trans activists nicknamed it &ldquo;Jurassic Clarke.&rdquo; It was there that researchers like Susan Bradley and Kenneth Zucker conducted their research that still contributes to the desistance myth. CAMH </span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/infamous-reparative-therapy-clinic-for-transgender-youth-set-to-close-bd4e960519c3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed in 2015</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after an investigation confirmed that reparative therapy &mdash; by then banned under Ontario law &mdash; was </span><a href="http://transadvocate.com/part-i-the-rise-and-fall-of-discosexology-dr-zucker-camh-conversion-therapy_n_19556.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still being performed there</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunter has repressed many of the memories from her time at Clarke, though she&rsquo;s been able to recover some medical records of her time there. &ldquo;Shivering &mdash; I shivered a lot when I was there,&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t cold; I was terrified. The memories &mdash; I try not to think of those memories because they cause a lot of pain. It&rsquo;s hard to explain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the therapy, she buried aspects of herself for decades and just tried to blend in. If she&rsquo;d been part of a study at CAMH, she&rsquo;d have surely been counted as a desister. But she had anger issues, including a rage that scared even her, and five years ago, &ldquo;it all came back,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I got to the point in the road where I couldn&rsquo;t go any farther.&rdquo; A therapist started helping her cope and transition, and now, at age 49, she&rsquo;s been &ldquo;full-time myself&rdquo; for two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Life is so much better. Friends who&rsquo;ve known me for a very long time say it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m a completely different person. I&rsquo;m outgoing, I&rsquo;m happy, I&rsquo;m full of life. Compared to what I once was &mdash; I was so shy, quiet, insecure, just everything about me had been crushed during those years.&rdquo; Her workplace respects her identity, she&rsquo;s been in a relationship for over a year, and life is stable and happy. &ldquo;I wish I could have had this 30 years ago.&rdquo;</span></p>

			</figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These stories demonstrate that kids are coming out as trans at a younger age because society increasingly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them to, not because society is somehow changing them. And though many families are now affirming of their trans kids, stories of gender repression still play out in homes across the country just like they did decades ago for Maynard, Scott, and Hunter &mdash; in large part because of the desistance myth. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The persistence of desistance</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the prevalence of the desistance myth, there are actually only a few &ldquo;experts&rdquo; still promoting the debunked theory. These voices, however, are elevated by conservative echo chambers and are increasingly reaching mainstream audiences, propagating the rejection of transgender kids by distorting, ignoring, or hiding the research that supports affirmation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul McHugh, a Johns Hopkins University professor, has long been the darling of anti-trans conservatives, who often rely on </span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/meet-the-doctor-social-conservatives-depend-on-to-justify-anti-transgender-hate-fe764009b93/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his opinion alone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to contradict mainstream medicine&rsquo;s affirming approach to transgender people. McHugh infamously </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/long-shadow-cast-by-psychiatrist-on-transgender-issues-finally-recedes-at-johns-hopkins/2017/04/05/e851e56e-0d85-11e7-ab07-07d9f521f6b5_story.html?utm_term=.e5784a36dfc4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Johns Hopkins&rsquo; sex reassignment surgery clinic in 1979 because he believed then, </span><a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2004/11/surgical-sex"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as he does to this day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that being trans is a mental illness and trans people do not benefit from transition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, McHugh sparked a new wave of interest in his perspective with a </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-mchugh-transgender-surgery-isnt-the-solution-1402615120"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comparing being transgender to having bulimia and dismissing surgery as a helpful solution. Last year, he and another Johns Hopkins scholar, Lawrence Mayer, published </span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/about-that-not-born-this-way-study-b3e07d0354f5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a massive report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that tried to undermine common understandings (and medical consensuses) about LGBTQ identities, claiming among other things that because of the desistance research, nothing supports affirming children as transgender. The New Atlantis, published by the anti-LGBTQ Ethics and Public Policy Center and the Center for the Study of Technology and Society, is </span><a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/rethinking-peer-review"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> peer-reviewed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the report notably contained no original research, but </span><a href="http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/23/report-debunks-born-that-way-narrative-and-transgender-label-for-kids/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conservatives heralded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it as game-changing anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report&rsquo;s flaws and biases were obvious. For example, despite its claim to be a &ldquo;careful summary&rdquo; of the relevant research, it conspicuously didn&rsquo;t mention any of the contemporary research Olson or others have published on transgender children. Mayer was taken aback that ThinkProgress and other outlets </span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/about-that-not-born-this-way-study-b3e07d0354f5/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critiqued the report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as anti-LGBTQ bigotry, but in emails to ThinkProgress at the time, he revealed his own biases. He claimed that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;untrue&rdquo; children have a sense of gender at ages as young as two, expressed concern that parents &ldquo;push&rdquo; their gender nonconforming children to believe they&rsquo;re transgender, and insisted, &ldquo;I truly believe we will regret, as a society, allowing children as young as two be characterized as transgendered [sic].&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some ways, </span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/publishers-of-anti-lgbt-special-report-doth-protest-too-much-7b57b5d6f3e2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the report backfired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, prompting many in the academic and medical communities </span><a href="https://undark.org/article/gender-lgbtq-paul-mchugh-science/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to criticize the university</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for silently allowing McHugh and Mayer to use its reputation to prop up their unscientific claims. Eventually, Johns Hopkins distanced itself from the two professors and even announced </span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/johns-hopkins-transgender-surgery-5c9c428184c1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it would be reopening</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the trans surgical clinic McHugh had closed decades ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, McHugh and Mayer, joined by Paul Hruz of Washington University in St. Louis, </span><a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/growingpains"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published another report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in The New Atlantis earlier this year objecting specifically to prescribing puberty blockers to trans kids. In it, they claim that children &ldquo;are not fully capable of understanding </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what it means</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be a man or a woman&rdquo; and that affirming their gender identity &ldquo;may drive some children to persist in identifying as transgender when they might otherwise have, as they grow older, found their gender to be aligned with their sex.&rdquo; Conservatives </span><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448885/children-gender-dysphoria-modern-treatments-go-too-far"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ate</span></a> <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2017/06/27/research-finds-parents-question-kids-gender-dysphoria-late/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it</span></a> <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2017/06/20/new-paper-says-puberty-blockers-arent-answer-gender-confusion/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=thf-tw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another vocal proponent of the desistance myth is the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds), a sham medical organization and </span><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2012/american-college-pediatricians-defames-gays-and-lesbians-name-protecting-children"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anti-LGBTQ hate group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to be confused with the legitimate American </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Pediatricians. In 2016, ACPeds </span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/hate-group-masquerading-as-pediatricians-attacks-transgender-youth-544e755c6a20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published a &ldquo;position statement&rdquo;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-authored by McHugh rejecting transgender kids. A few months later, the group&rsquo;s president, Michelle Cretella, published </span><a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/american-college-pediatricians-transgender-kids-falsehoods-384716df13c5/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a more extensive manifesto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &mdash; propped up primarily by the desistance myth &mdash; outlining their objections to affirming transgender kids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently, Cretella, who also </span><a href="https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/parenting-issues/empowering-parents-of-gender-discordant-and-same-sex-attracted-children-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for ex-gay therapy, claimed that the field of medicine has been </span><a href="http://dailysignal.com/2017/07/03/im-pediatrician-transgender-ideology-infiltrated-field-produced-large-scale-child-abuse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">infiltrated by the transgender movement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, countering with her belief that affirming transgender kids is &ldquo;child abuse.&rdquo; Medical professionals, she wrote, are &ldquo;engaging in massive, uncontrolled, and unconsented experimentation on children who have a psychological condition that would otherwise resolve after puberty in the vast majority of cases,&rdquo; reiterating the myth that transition is somehow being pushed on children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Heritage Foundation published her piece, Tucker Carlson lifted up her perspectives </span><a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/07/25/tucker-carlson-teams-hate-group-spread-junk-science-about-transgender-kids/217374"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on his Fox News show, where she again rejected the legitimacy of transgender identities, called affirmation &ldquo;child abuse,&rdquo; and reiterated the desistance myth (bumping the usual statistic from 80 percent all the way up to 95 percent). She claimed that since young children engage in &ldquo;magical thinking&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know the difference so easily between fantasy and reality,&rdquo; parents and physicians must encourage them to accept their assigned gender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other supporters of the desistance myth with medical credentials pop up all over the place. Eric Vilain, a pediatrician and geneticist then-based at UCLA, </span><a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Transgender-Kids-Eligible-for-Earlier-Medical-Intervention-Under-New-Guidelines-423082734.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the NBC Bay Area Investigative Unit recently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that children are unfairly &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; to socially transition. Australian doctor Stephen Stathis </span><a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/minority-of-children-with-gender-issues-diagnosed-with-gender-dysphoria-psychiatrist-says/news-story/2d8a6725d98e5f5bf3f7e5e9eb99d065"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently claimed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that teens are &ldquo;trying out being transgender&hellip; [like] it&rsquo;s the new black.&rdquo; Kenneth Zucker, who has continued to operate a private psychiatric practice since CAMH closed, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/11/bbc-film-on-child-transgender-issues-worries-activists"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently appeared in a BBC documentary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on transgender kids to say, among other things, &ldquo;A four-year-old might say that he&rsquo;s a dog. Do you go out and buy dog food?&rdquo; His desistance research colleague Susan Bradley claimed earlier this year </span><a href="http://nationalpost.com/opinion/susan-bradley-how-trans-activists-are-unethically-influencing-autistic-children-to-change-genders"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Canada&rsquo;s National Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the trans movement is trying to coopt autistic children into being trans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2015/06/02/what-the-media-should-know-about-walt-heyer-and/203855"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;ex-trans&rdquo; activist Walt Heyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> claims he was previously trans, even though he has also admitted that he was misdiagnosed, but he has nevertheless capitalized on the desistance myth as a facet of his anti-trans advocacy, implying that his own story reinforces it. Kids should not even be allowed to socially transition, </span><a href="http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2017/06/19512/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he warned earlier this summer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t change the empirical fact that no one is able to predict which gender dysphoric children will remain gender dysphoric as time goes on.&rdquo; Heyer&rsquo;s anti-trans narrative is often lauded by conservatives; in fact, the White House </span><a href="https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/white-house-includes-article-controversial-walt-heyer-newsletter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently promoted Heyer&rsquo;s defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of President Trump&rsquo;s ban on trans military service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are even some in the mainstream media who&rsquo;ve stridently promoted the desistance myth. New York Magazine&rsquo;s Jesse Singal, for example, </span><a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/you-should-watch-the-bbcs-kenneth-zucker-documentary.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regularly</span></a> <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">defends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> those who are skeptical of letting kids transition. Last year, he published </span><a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/07/whats-missing-from-the-conversation-about-transgender-kids.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his own analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the desistance myth, in which he excused every one of the studies&rsquo; many flaws. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a kid meeting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the necessary criteria in the DSM-IV and not &lsquo;actually&rsquo; being gender dysphoric,&rdquo; he claimed, ignoring that the antiquated diagnosis didn&rsquo;t actually require &ldquo;all&rdquo; the criteria. He likewise shrugged off the fact that many of the participants didn&rsquo;t even meet </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many who advocate for trans equality have dubbed these pro-desistance preachers &ldquo;</span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brynn-tannehill/how-to-spot-antitrans-con_b_8055816.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concern trolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; for the way they claim to be concerned about what&rsquo;s best for kids as a cover for the anti-transgender message they&rsquo;re promoting. Julia Serano has </span><a href="https://medium.com/@juliaserano/detransition-desistance-and-disinformation-a-guide-for-understanding-transgender-children-993b7342946e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they&rsquo;re promoting a double standard when it comes to what kind of puberty kids should go through. They are concerned that the kids they assume will desist will be pushed into the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; puberty with hormone therapy and ultimately surgery, when in fact it&rsquo;s trans kids that they actually want to force to go through the wrong puberty, which will only exacerbate their gender dysphoria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;If the former example concerns you, but the latter one doesn&rsquo;t, then that&rsquo;s a clear sign that you value cis bodies and lives over trans ones,&rdquo; she wrote last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, that&rsquo;s the prejudice inherent in desistance: that kids will be better off if they turn out </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be transgender. Full of speculation and hope about how these children </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turn out in the future, proponents of the myth casually disregard what&rsquo;s most important to these families: the health and well-being of their children </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the present</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Conner McLaren recalled, &ldquo;When I was a boy, I was holding down this geyser or growing ocean of distress and sadness that took a lot out of me. I knew I just couldn&rsquo;t do it&hellip; There&rsquo;s an ocean growing inside in me that&rsquo;s filled with my tears, filled with my sadness, and hate for what my body is.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As political and legal battles continue to be waged over how our schools and our society should respond to these kids, opponents of transgender equality will no doubt continue to wield the desistance myth as their weapon. But it is just a myth, and one that offers nothing to account for how transgender children across this country are thriving when they&rsquo;re affirmed in their gender identities.</span></p>
